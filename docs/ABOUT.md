# TimeWorm

## What It Is

TimeWorm is an application for experiencing timeline data. Rather than presenting timelines in a single fixed format, TimeWorm lets you view the same sequence of events through many different visual lenses—each offering a unique way to see and understand your data.

## The Core Idea

Any set of events that happen over time can be thought of as a timeline: historical events, project milestones, personal memories, scientific discoveries, a band's discography, or the episodes of your favorite show. TimeWorm takes this timeline data and presents it through interchangeable visualizations.

Think of it like choosing different ways to display the same photographs—you might arrange them chronologically on a wall, stack them in albums, spread them across a table, or project them as a slideshow. The photos don't change, but your experience of them does.

## How It Works

**One Timeline, Many Views**

At its heart, TimeWorm separates your data from how it's displayed. You create a timeline—a collection of events with dates, titles, descriptions, and other details—and then choose how to visualize it. Want to see your events flowing like a river? Switch to that view. Prefer something that feels like walking through a museum exhibit? There's a view for that too. The same data, presented differently.

**Your Library of Timelines**

TimeWorm is designed to be a home for all your timelines. You can create new timelines, upload data to populate them, and save them under meaningful names. Each timeline remembers which visualization you've chosen for it, so when you return to your library and select a timeline, it appears exactly as you left it.

**Browse and Select**

From the home screen, you can see all your saved timelines and select which one to view. Each timeline is its own complete experience—your data, your chosen visualization, ready to explore.

**Edit and Customize**

When you want to make changes, you can enter an edit mode. Here you can modify the timeline's events, adjust their details, or switch to a different visualization. The application is designed so you can always see your data while working with it—editing feels connected to the experience rather than separate from it.

## What Makes It Different

Most timeline tools lock you into one way of seeing things. TimeWorm treats visualization as a choice, not a constraint. The same historical timeline might feel contemplative when viewed as a quiet vertical scroll, dynamic when presented as a train journey between stations, or immersive when experienced as a museum walkthrough.

This flexibility means TimeWorm can adapt to different purposes: educational presentations, personal archives, research exploration, or simply finding the most satisfying way to experience a particular set of events.

## The Vision

TimeWorm aims to make timeline data feel less like information and more like experience. By offering many visualization options—and making it easy to switch between them—it invites you to find the presentation that resonates with your content and your purpose.

Your timelines. Your way of seeing them.
