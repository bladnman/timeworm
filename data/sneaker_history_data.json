The Air Jordan 1, designed by Peter Moore in the Chicago Bulls' black and red colors, was unlike anything on basketball courts—so bold that the NBA initially banned it for violating uniform rules.\n\nNike turned the ban into marketing gold, running ads claiming 'The NBA threw them out of the game. Fortunately, the NBA can't stop you from wearing them.' Jordan wore them anyway, paying the $5,000 per-game fines. In its first year, the Air Jordan line generated $126 million in sales, far exceeding Nike's initial $3 million projection.",
