Born from Japan's atomic trauma in 1954, this towering reptile has spent seven decades reflecting society's deepest fears back at itself: nuclear annihilation, environmental destruction, government incompetence, and the hubris of technology. From somber allegory to campy hero to CGI spectacle, Godzilla has been reinvented for every generation while remaining cinema's most enduring kaiju.",

The film is largely about government bureaucracy—endless meetings, jurisdictional disputes, approval processes—while a mutating Godzilla devastates Tokyo. It's a scathing critique of Japanese governmental dysfunction during the 2011 nuclear disaster.\n\nShin Godzilla's design was disturbing: a creature in constant, painful evolution, with tiny arms, dead eyes, and eventually dorsal spines that shoot atomic beams. The film was Japan's highest-grossing live-action film of 2016 and won seven Japan Academy Prizes.",
